## Team Charter
From the team goals, which can be reviewed in "Appendix: Team Organization", the team's charter was formed to be:

>"Team 304 is focused on teamwork, meaning proper collaboration, communication, and ideas. Each team member contributes to team assignments and learns the necessary skills for each assignment and display the full suite of engineering. We also strive to complete our work to the best of our abilities." (Team 304's Charter)

This charter was agreed upon because all our team members value teamwork and effort, and it aligns with our team goals as outlined in the [Appendix](https://egr314-s-2026-304.github.io/Appendix/01-Organization-Information/Append-Organization/) section. We created this charter to reflect both of those in a concise and clear paragraph.

## Product Mission Statement

 > "Team 304’s mission is to develop a connected, app-controlled astronomical scope that autonomously identifies and tracks stars, dynamically adjusts exposure and shutter settings, and captures clear celestial images."

This mission statement was agreed upon by combining the team's charter and goals, then combining with the project requirements of an "exploration device".
