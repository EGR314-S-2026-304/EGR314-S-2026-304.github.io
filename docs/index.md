## Team Introduction
Team 304 is a 3-person team consisting of Dylan, Quinn, and Roshan. All are students in the EGR 314 course taught by Professor Kevin Nichols at Arizona State University. For this course, our team was tasked wth building an exploration device using sensors, actuators, Wi-Fi or bluetooth, I2C, SPI, and UART communication between subsystems. To complete this project, our group has developed an Automated Electronic Telescope using the knowledge and materials provided by this course.
