## Overview

The EGR 314 project states, "create an exploration device". This is a vague ask that leaves many options for interpretation. Team 304 is committed to creating a device that uses a UART daisy chain netwrok to accomplish this exploration device. Similarly to EGR 304, the team is required to create and document everything while building this project. One of the largest changes to EGR 314 is that the PCB manufactured will be surface mounted components compared to EGR 304's through hole components.

As for the audience of our device, we want to target the curious, the people who maybe are limited to the constraint of not working for companies that do have the resources to explore. Team 304 aims to satisfy the ordinary that would like to explore from the comfort of their own home and not spend large amounts of money on excessively powered equipment.
