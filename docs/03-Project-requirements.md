## Overview
The following sections document the requirements that Team 304 should meet. Below is a table listing requirements in which we feel are sufficient for this project. We have also included other useful information about each requirement, as well as whether the requirement is among our stretch goal.

### How our features became requirements
  - **User Interface**: 
  - **WI-FI Connectivity**: The Wi-fi system will be used to 
  - **Camera System**: The camera system is essential for the telescope to see objects.
  - **Motor**: The motor is required for moving the Automated Telescope to the correct position.
  - **Selection and Switch**:
